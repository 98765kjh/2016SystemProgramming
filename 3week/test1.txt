<Elephant and the Bees>

Long Long ago, in the beginning of the time, in the jungles of Tahiland there lived elephants.

Jungle elephants who roamed through the paths of jungle.
Now, the elephants long ago did not quite look the way elephants do today.

In those long ago beginning days elephants had short, pudgy little noses.
One day as the elephants were walking in a small herd through the jungle, they put up their pudgy noses and sniffed.

Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, What is that smell?
Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, it was something strange.
Oh, it was smoke; it was smoke beginning to come through the jungle

Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, What is that smell?
Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, it was something strange.
Oh, it was smoke; it was smoke beginning to come through the jungle

Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, What is that smell?
Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, it was something strange.
Oh, it was smoke; it was smoke beginning to come through the jungle

Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, What is that smell?
Keung.Keung.Keung. Oh, it was something strange.
Oh, it was smoke; it was smoke beginning to come through the jungle

And they flew through the jungle. And the elephants said, "Oh, where, where should we go."
